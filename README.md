# Assignment for cs231n
The full name of cs231n is *Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*, which is a really fantastic class for the application of neural network in visual recognition. The instructors are FeiFei Li, Andrej Karpathy and Justin Johnson. The all instructors, especially Andrej Karpathy i think, are good at showing you how the network by doing visualization job on neural network to let you know how it work.

The class will teach students how to implement their own neural network, and how to train and debug the network, by doing this, you will have a good cognition for neural network and computer vision. In the final of the class, you will train a neural network with millions of parameters, and apply it on the biggest image classification library globally---ImageNet.

The requirement for this class is that you have to be skillful at **python** and **C/C++**. And the main part of the assignment is using python and the science calculation library, like numpy. The students have to be familiar with *linear algebra and probability*(one of college class), for the reason that there exists much matrix calcalation and many conception, like Gaussian distribution, mean, standard, etc.

**Hint**:This is a python-3.5 version
